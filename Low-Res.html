        <h2>Low-Res User Testing</h2>
        <p id="int_name"><b>Testing Details</b></p>
            <p>
                - We tested 4 users on two different prototypes and had them navigate through three different scenarios for each prototype. Half of the users were shown prototype 1 first (tracks not on home page) and then prototype 2 (tracks on home page), and the other half were shown the opposite arrangement. The scenarios were as follows: <br><br>
                - Scenario 1:  Say you’re looking to add some technical skills like specific programming languages to your resume - can you walk me through what track/tutorials you would choose? <br> <br>
                - Scenario 2: Say you’re looking for a tutorial on photo editing, but you don’t really want to stick to a single track. Could you walk me through how you’d go about finding that tutorial without first going to a track? <br> <br>
                - Scenario 3: Now that you’ve “finished” the tutorial from Scenario 2, can you walk me through how you’d navigate back to choose another tutorial?

        <p id="int_name"><b>Testing Summary (What did we learn?)</b></p>
            <p>
                - Having Tracks on the homepage is better because it gives the user a clearer and more immediate understanding of our site. <br>
                - The plan is to still include Tracks on the navigation bar, but instead of going to a separate page it will just scroll to where the tracks are listed on the homepage 

            </p>
        <p id="int_name"><b>User 1 Test (Facilitated by Lindsay)</b></p>
            <p>
                - When tracks are not on home page, the user doesn’t really have any indication of what the website is about or what tracks even are, and my user was really confused by this <br>
                - We thought tracks might be better suited for people who aren’t sure what they want, but browsing tutorials can also be helpful for uncertain users to get an idea of everything available to them <br>
                - From this experience, tracks on the homepage are better because the user gains an immediate understanding of the available options, without any apprehension about whether they want recommendations or not.

            </p>
        <p id="int_name"><b>User 2 Test (Facilitated by Cecilia)</b></p>
            <p>
                - The user preferred the prototype without the descriptions of the Tracks on the home page, mainly because it is repetitive information (identical to the actual Tracks page) and thought it was unnecessary or unhelpful. <br>
                - The user comes from a background of some level of tech experience, so they did not express any trouble or concern navigating for both prototypes, and since the user had previously been interviewed for User Interviews, they did not question what tracks were and what the purpose of the website was. It came intuitively to them, knowing the nature of the website and its purpose.

        <p id="int_name"><b>User 3 Test (Facilitated by Hafsah)</b></p>
            <p>
                - This user had also been interviewed for the User Interviews deliverable so they were already familiar with the background of our site, but they don’t have a technical background <br>
                - The user preferred the prototype with Tracks on the Home page, saying that it was significantly better than the prototype that required them to go to the separate Tracks page. They also liked the navigation system of the site because there were “not too many options to get confused by”.

            </p>
        <p id="int_name"><b>User 4 Test (Facilitated by Amy)</b></p>
            <p>
                - This user also preferred the prototype with Tracks on the Home page because it had all the necessary information <br>
                - This user testing confirmed results from the previous tests - most users preferred having access to the information about Tracks on the Home page. It eliminates an extra step for them and makes the purpose of the site more clear
