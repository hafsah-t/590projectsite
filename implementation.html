        <h2>Implementation User Testing</h2>
        <p>Our implementation testing was completed during the class testing period. Because everyone in the class is a computer science major, it was difficult to get feedback that is representative of users with no technical experience. However, we still got great feedback about the overall design and flow of our site. Going through the tutorials with some users helped highlight points where a user might get confused at where to go next (ex: we had an option to go to the VS Code Tips or the HTML tutorial after completing the original VS Code tutorial. However, due to the placement of the buttons, users would automatically pick the HTML one. We fixed this by only putting the VS Code Tips button because the content in the Tips tutorial is helpful before proceeding to the HTML one). Also, our classmates pointed out some screenshots that were a little difficult to see because they lacked a border, and they also recommended that we make it more obvious at the end of the tutorial that the user should proceed to the next one. We used these tips to finish our implementation (which includes our web dev tutorials and sign in page).</p>
