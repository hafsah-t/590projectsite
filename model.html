            Notes: <br><br>
            Our conceptual model includes three main entities: <br><br>
                - User (the person using the site) <br>
                - Track (a specified path that users have the option to choose) <br>
                - Tutorial (the actual tutorial for users to complete) <br> <br>
            
            Our conceptual model includes 3 total relationships: <br><br>
            - The first relationship is between the User and the Track entities. This is a one to many relationship, meaning that a User can choose many Tracks. Both entities have partial participation in this relationship - a User does not have to choose a Track and a Track does not have to be chosen by a User to exist. <br><br>
            - The second relationship is between the User and Tutorial entities. This is a one to many relationship, meaning that a User can complete many Tutorials. Both entities have partial participation in this relationship - a User does not have to complete a Tutorial and a Tutorial does not have to be completed by a User to exist. <br><br>
            - The third relationship is between the Track and Tutorial entities. This is a many to many relationship, meaning that a Track can include many Tutorials, and a Tutorial may be included in more than one Track. The Tutorial entity has partial participation in this relationship - it does not have to be included within a Track to exist. The Track entity has total participation in this relationship - a Track has to include a Tutorial in order to exist. <br><br>
