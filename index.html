        <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Project title:</b> TechU
                <br><br>

                <b>Description:</b> TechU is a beginner-friendly technology tutorial website targeted to students and professionals with non-technical backgrounds who want to expand their technical skills, including but not limited to website building, introductory Python, and Adobe creative cloud. Users will be asked about their desired track, and depending on their choice, they will be given tutorials to choose from. The tutorials will provide a background about the technology and how it can benefit them, and include text or video instructions, beginner level problems and a practice project.
                <br><br>

                <b>Target audience:</b> Students or professionals with non-technical backgrounds who want to learn additional technical skills in relation to their interests and/or career path.  
                <br><br>

                <b>Competition:</b> Other tech learning platforms: Leetcode, Codecademy, freeCodeCamp.
                <br><br>

                <b>What sets us apart:</b>  Focus on non technical learners; most coding apps and platforms heavily focus on people who are already in a technical career path, which can be intimidating. Theming examples around peopleâ€™s career and interests can also be more motivating. The app is also free whereas most skill learning sites cost money.
