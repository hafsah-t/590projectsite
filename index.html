                Project title: Gone Coding 
                <br><br>
                Description: Gone Coding is a beginner-friendly coding website targeted to 
                students and professionals with non-technical backgrounds who want to learn coding. 
                Users will be asked about their career path/major, and depending on their choice, 
                they will be given one or two language tutorials to choose from. 
                The tutorials will provide a background about the coding language and how it relates to the career 
                path/major, and include beginner level problems.
                <br><br>
                Target audience: Students or professionals with non-technical backgrounds who want to 
                learn coding in relation to their interests and career path.  
                <br><br>
                Competition: Other coding-specific learning platforms - Leetcode, Codecademy, freeCodeCamp.
                <br><br>
                What sets us apart: Focus on non technical learners; most coding apps and platforms 
                heavily focus on people who are already in a technical career path, which can be intimidating. 
                Theming examples around peopleâ€™s career and interests can also be more motivating than 
                just a cut and dry coding problem. The app is also free whereas most coding bootcamps cost money. 
                The platform is also open-source, so developers can contribute practice 
                problems and content based on their nontechnical knowledge.
