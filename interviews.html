            Our user interviews were mainly conducted with individuals with non-technical backgrounds, but they have varying levels of exposure to different technologies and languages including but not limited to Excel, Adobe Creative Cloud Software, R, and Python. The age range of those interviewed was between 19 and 24 years old, and our targeted audience of users continues to be college-aged students either just entering university or in grad school. While some of the interviewees described academics as part of their motivation for learning new technical skills, many also mentioned personal interests such as video editing, photography, and music production as reasons for seeking tutorials for tech skills or applications. As for preferences for learning new concepts, the interviewees offered a variety of perspectives. Some prefer video over text and small hints that nudge them towards the right answer, while others appreciate concise textual descriptions and information about exactly what they're doing wrong. However, most agree that tutorials should be short and sweet, and that longer tutorials with too much information in the introduction and conclusion can be overwhelming. From these insights, we believe it will be helpful to provide a couple of options for users who prefer some methods of learning over others. Finally, the interviewees recommended we avoid assuming prior knowledge about the users of our site, and to make it accessible to beginners by including short and understandable summaries about why skills would be useful to learn.

        <h2>Interview Summaries: </h2>

        <p id="int_name"><b>Interview 1: Gha Young</b></p>
            <p>
                Gha Young (24) is currently a med student who completed her undergraduate degree in Chemistry and Physics. She has a decent background in technology, since she took multiple computer science and computational chemistry courses out of her own interest. She found that the concepts related to her majors and career interest (physician) were the ones she enjoyed the most and uses to this day. She prefers text-based tutorials rather than videos, since they are more efficient to digest, and prefers personally relatable contexts. She actively seeks relevant technical tools and finds herself learning best by practicing on her own after viewing explicit examples, with optional hints as needed. She is interested in using our platform if it offers technologies related to her field, but would be even more interested if there was a learning incentive (i.e. leaderboards and competitions).

        <p id="int_name"><b>Interview 2: David </b></p>
            <p>
                David (20) is a junior majoring in Advertising at SFSU’s Journalism Department who aspires to work at an ad agency or become a copywriter. He took a technical (APCSI) course in high school since a lot of high schoolers at the time were taking it, and didn’t enjoy it - but learns other technical skills for his classes, recreational use, or for his musical career (like Adobe Creative Cloud Software and music production softwares). He learns best when the information is straight and to the point, and doesn’t like it when tutorials are dragged on with useless information and introduction/conclusion. He prefers if the learning content is applicable to his hobbies or his career interests, and finds explicit examples helpful, especially when he is stuck, he learns best when he is given the solution so that he can produce it on his own later. He is interested in using our website as needed, if the convenience is appealing to him at the time. 
            </p>

        <p id="int_name"><b>Interview 3: Yasmine </b></p>
            <p>
                Yasmine (21) is majoring in Integrated Physiology and Neuroscience, along with a minor in Biomanufacturing. She does not have a lot of technical experience, but has used Excel frequently for her biomanufacturing classes, as well as Adobe Lightroom because of her interest in photography. She has not considered a career in information technology (her current goal is to go to grad school or pursue dentistry), but if she was interested in a job that required technical skills (ex: learning a programming language), she would definitely self-teach and reach out to friends for resources. Part of the reason she chose her minor was because it has a 99% employment rate out of graduation, so she is more likely to pursue options (ex: different career path/skills) if someone can efficiently explain the benefits and probabilities of success. As for learning new skills, she prefers watching videos vs just reading text, but also appreciates different combinations of practices (ex: watching video, then practicing, etc.). She has an easier time when tutorials go step by step, but if trying to learn a concept, she prefers nudges in the right direction. She would be interested in using our website, especially if she pursues her photography interests more and needs help with making a website.  However, she wants us to keep accessibility in mind and thinks that it is important that each tutorial/skill we offer comes with an explanation of why it is important (and explained in language that is easy to understand). 
            </p>
        
        <p id="int_name"><b>Interview 4: Maryam </b></p>
            <p>
                Maryam (20) is majoring in Neuroscience, and does not consider herself too tech savvy. She took COMP 110 - Introduction to Programming - because it was required for her major, and although she did not enjoy the class too much, she did think it was applicable to going into the workforce, especially because of a greater prevalence of remote/virtual work. Her experience with different technologies include Microsoft Office, Canva, and Adobe (for video editing). She has not considered a career in information technology because she is unsure if she'd be interested in it, but thinks that learning technical skills might be helpful for her career/academics. As for learning these new skills, she does not necessarily care about hearing other experiences or statistics if she was already interested, but if not, then those additions would be beneficial. She considers videos to be helpful (short and clear screen recordings) but tends to prefer reading concise text that outlines steps clearly. In the future, she would want to use our site if she wanted/needed to learn something for class or a future job, but wants it to be easily accessible and relevant to her needs. 
            </p>
        
        <p id="int_name"><b>Interview 5: Ella </b></p>
            <p>
                Ella (22) is majoring in Studio Art and Global Studies, and is actively searching for career opportunities in international relations. She has experience and is ok with navigating some non-coding technologies such as the Adobe creative cloud suite for her art, and has taken a class on analyzing public opinion using R which she felt was extremely relevant to government/public policy work. If she were to learn another language it would be Python, since she’s seen that in many job posting and career advice sites before and would like to put it on her resume. For this reason, she would be more motivated to use our site if it were relevant to her career goals, and if she had something tangible to show for it at the end such as a certification or a project she built step by step. When she is learning, she prefers that information be presented in a short and concise way, slightly preferring video over text. The most important aspects when she chooses a tutorial are good visuals and summarizing/presenting key takeaways at the beginning and end of each section, as well as providing some hints as she works through practice problems.

        <p id="int_name"><b>Interview 6: Serenity </b></p>
            <p>
                Serenity (19) is a freshman majoring in Physics and Computer Science, and has some technical experience in programming languages such as R and Python as she has previously taken AP Computer Science during her time in high school. When considering her own personal experiences doing learning tutorials, she does not retain what she learns by just watching someone, but through a hands-on learning approach in which she follows along at the same time, step-by-step through the process of her tutorials. She prefers tutorials to be concise and straight to the point without any unnecessary introductions and ending conclusions. Additionally, she enjoys following along to videos that are accommodated with either closed captioning and/or an audio transcript that includes timestamps which allows her to easily skim and click back to the important contents of the tutorial. For her, it is easier to digest the material if she is able to see and hear the instructions. She considers herself a very competitive person, so adding a competitive component to tutorials such as a leaderboard would retain her interest in learning the material. Although she enjoys astrophysics and coding, Serenity has voiced interest in digital art and is very interested in taking a course on utilizing useful applications such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to develop her digital art skills. Serenity would be interested in using our site to develop her skill set in digital art and her other personal interests.
